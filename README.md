# Troubleshooting.SDK

## Goal
This project is used to interview applicants on real world problems in an Actor Model based program using dependency injection.

## Setup
PostSharp is required for this program to work. An "Essentials" license is free and should be sufficient for this purpose.
Once that is installed into Visual Studio, then you can clone this repository and run a nuget package restore.
